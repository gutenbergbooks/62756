<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>In 1839, Margaret Fuller, delicate in
health and much overtaxed, consented
to gratify many who loved her
by opening in Boston a series of “Conversations
for Women.” In a Circular
quoted by Emerson, she says to Mrs.
Sophia Ripley:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Could a circle be assembled in earnest,
desirous to answer the questions, ‘What were
we born to do?’ and ‘How shall we do it?’ I
should think the undertaking a noble one.”</p>

</div>

<p>This was certainly the original intent
of the famous “Fuller Conversations,”
which, beginning then, were continued at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
intervals, until Margaret left Boston for
New York in 1844.</p>

<p>It seems a little singular, therefore, to
find her writing to Ralph Waldo Emerson
of this series, Nov. 25, 1839, as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The first day’s topic was the genealogy
of Heaven and Earth; then the Will or
Jupiter; the Understanding, Mercury: the
second day’s, The celestial inspiration of
Genius, perception and transmission of Divine
Law; Apollo the terrene inspiration, Bacchus
the impassioned abandonment. Of the thunderbolt,
the caduceus, the ray and the grape,
having disposed as well as might be, we came
to the wave and the sea-shell it moulds to
beauty....</p>

<p>“I assure you, there is more Greek than
Bostonian spoken at the meetings!”</p>

</div>

<p>Under the forms suggested by Mythology,
Margaret proceeded to open all
the great questions of life. In a literary
sense, she distinctly stated that she knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
little about the doings on Olympus, nor
had she received any help from German
critical works,—of which at the present
day she would have found many.</p>

<p>These Conversations owed their attraction
first to the absolute novelty of her
theme to many of those she addressed,
and still more to the variety and freshness
of her own treatment. The opening,
at the Boston Athenæum, of the
splendid collection of casts presented by
Thomas Handasyd Perkins, and many
private collections of pictures, engravings,
gems, and miniature casts, had interested
her intensely, and both mind and
fancy were absorbed in the contemplation
of their themes. In these Conversations
she depicted what she had gained
from Art, rather than the little that she
had acquired through study. If I may
judge from a later experience, her Latin
studies rather injured than developed her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
brilliant fancies. She never could remember
what she had said, never could
repeat a brilliant saying, and, if obliged
to read any illustration, read it, as all her
friends admitted, very badly. From a
statement made to Emerson, I quote the
following:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Her mood applied itself to the mood of her
companion, point to point, in the most limber,
sinuous, vital way; ... and this sympathy
she had for all persons indifferently.”</p>

</div>

<p>The communication of which the above
is a sample I have always read with
amazement, for I never knew a person
of whom it would seem less true. When
conversing with one sympathetic person,
it was undoubtedly true; when resting
upon the affection and loyalty of her
young women,—a most gifted and extraordinary
circle,—it was doubtless
equally so; but when the class of March,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
1841, was formed, a very different aspect
of herself appeared.</p>

<p>The fame of her “talks” had spread.
She had great need of money, and some
of the gentlemen who were accustomed
to talk with her, and some of the ladies
of her day-class, suggested an evening
class, to be composed of both ladies and
gentlemen, and to meet at the house of
the Rev. George Ripley in Bedford Place.
Ten Conversations were to be held, and
the tickets of admission cost twenty
dollars each, a very high price for that
time. It was in the book-room of Elisabeth
Peabody that I first heard them discussed.
I was very young to join such
a circle; and when she invited me, Elisabeth
had more regard, I think, to Margaret’s
purse, than to my fitness for the
company. But it was a great opportunity.
The members were full of excitement
over the projected opening of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Brook Farm. All were in good spirits,
and bright sayings ran back and forth.
I had been carefully trained in the Art
of Reporting, and at that time made
careful abstracts on the following day of
any lecture that had interested me. In
these I trusted to my memory. It was
not possible to do this with the Conversations;
so I invented a sort of short-hand,
and carried note-book and pencil
with me. I sat a little out of sight
that I might not embarrass Margaret, but
Elisabeth Peabody and Mrs. Farrar found
me out. Elisabeth wrote what she called
an abstract, every night; but an examination
of her abstracts quoted by Mr. Emerson
shows that what she wrote was not
what any one said, but the impression
made upon her own mind by it. These
abstracts she always read to me, the next
morning. I wrote out my short-hand
notes before breakfast and carried them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
down to her about noon. I greatly enjoyed
listening to her papers, and she
was so absorbed in them that she often
forgot to ask for mine, which was a great
relief to me.</p>

<p>So far as I know, these Reports of
mine are the only attempt ever made
deliberately to represent these or any
of Margaret’s “Conversations” word for
word. Of course, much was omitted as
not worth recording, nor did I ever write
down anything that I could not understand.
Many of the members I knew
intimately, and fell naturally into writing
of them by initials and first names,
as they always spoke to and of each
other. At times I fell back into the
Mr., Mrs., or Miss, which was my own
habit. It is well to call those we love
by any name they will permit, but the
familiar habit of the Transcendental
circle was full of social peril to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
younger members, who, conceiving it a
proof of genius, followed it, when its
origin was forgotten, and were much
misunderstood in consequence in later
years.</p>

<p>I offer the Reports exactly as they
were written. I should like to alter
them in several small ways if I could do
it honestly. We met to discuss Grecian
Mythology as interpreted to Margaret’s
mind by Art; but Latin and Greek names
were used as if they were synonymous,
and Latin poems were quoted, as well as
Greek traditions. This confused my
mind then, and does still. Athene and
Minerva, Zeus and Jupiter, are by no
means the same persons to me, Art or
no Art.</p>

<p>It may be thought by those who cannot
remember the persons who enacted
this little drama, or by those who do
remember and know well how very distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
a company this was, that I
should have eliminated my own reflections,
and dropped out of the story.</p>

<p>This would I think have been greatly
unjust to Margaret, who never enjoyed
this mixed class, and considered it a failure
so far as her own power was concerned.
She and Mr. Emerson met like
Pyramus and Thisbe, a blank wall between.
With Mr. Alcott she had no
patience, and no one of the class seemed
to understand how sincere and deep was
her interest in the theme. In no way
was Margaret’s supremacy so evident
as in the impulse she gave to the minds
of younger women.</p>

<p>It was the wish of Margaret’s mother
and brothers, as it is also the wish of her
surviving relatives, that I should print
these pages. After Arthur’s death,
Richard Fuller undertook to carry out a
plan to which both had agreed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
which Margaret’s mother had greatly at
heart. They desired that I should write
a simple, straightforward account of Margaret,
including her residence in Italy,
her marriage, the birth of her child, and
her death. This they intended to print
at their own expense, and they thought
it might be so written as to put an end to
many absurd and painful rumors which
had followed the publication of the first
Memoir. That I might prepare for this,
all Margaret’s manuscripts were in my
custody for more than a year. The
completion of the work was prevented
by Richard Fuller’s unexpected death.
No surviving member of the family was
able to carry out his intention.</p>

<p>I still have in my possession the estimate
of his sister’s character which
Richard made for my use.</p>

<p>I should like to add, that the scholar
will see that the stories from Apuleius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and Novalis do not exactly correspond
to the originals. They were reported
exactly as they were told.</p>

first Attorney-General; another is the well-known
Senator from Massachusetts to the
Congress of the United States; and a third,
Edward Sherman Hoar, was distinguished
as a scholar and botanist. To great intellectual
gifts, Elisabeth added personal loveliness
and a saintly serenity of character.
She was betrothed to Charles Emerson (a
brother of Ralph Waldo Emerson), who
died of sudden illness just before the time
appointed for their marriage. He was also
a rarely gifted person, and after his death
his family transferred their tenderest affection
to Elisabeth. The reader of the various
Lives of Emerson will see that she is
often mentioned, and several of Emerson’s
letters are addressed to her. Had she
chosen to devote herself to literature, she
would have been greatly distinguished.

<h1>MARGARET AND HER FRIENDS.</h1>

<h2 id="I">I.</h2>

<p class="right"><i>Monday Evening, March 1, 1841.</i></p>

<p>Margaret opened the conversation by
a beautiful sketch of the origin of Mythology.
The Greeks she thought borrowed
their Gods from the Hindus and
Egyptians, but they idealized their personifications
to a far greater extent.
The Hindus dwelt in the All, the Infinite,
which the Greeks analyzed and to
some degree humanized. All things
sprang from Cœlus and Terra.,—that is,
from Heaven and Earth, or spirit and
matter. Rhea, or the Productive Energy,
and Saturn, or Time, were the children
of Cœlus and Terra. The progress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of any people is marked by its mythi.
Mythology is only the history of the development
of the Infinite in the Finite.
Saturn devoured his own children until
the disappointed Rhea put a stone (or
obstacle) in his way, and she succeeded
in raising Jupiter. The development of
human faculties was slow, therefore Time
seemed to absorb all that Productive
Energy brought forth, until Energy itself
created obstacles; and of these was born
the Indomitable Will. Jupiter represented
that Will, and usurped the rule of
Time, fighting with the low and sensual
passions, represented by the Titans and
the Giants, until he seated himself
securely on the Olympian Throne, the
Father of the Gods. This Will was not in
itself the highest development of either
Beauty, Genius, Wisdom, or Thought;
but such developments were subject to
it, were its children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Juno is only the feminine form of this
Indomitable Will. By herself she is
inferior to it, and whenever she opposes
it, loses the game. Vulcan, her child, is
Mechanic Art, great in itself to be sure,
but not comparable to the Perfect Wisdom,
or Minerva, which sprang ready
armed from the masculine Will. <em>She</em>
was greater than her Father, but still his
child.</p>

<p>Neptune, who raises always a “placid
head above the waves,” represents the
flow of thought,—all-embracing, girdling
in the world, Diana and Apollo, or Purity
and Genius.</p>

<p>Mercury is Genius in the extrinsic, of
eloquence, human understanding, and
expression. All were the embodiments
of Absolute Ideas, of ideas that had
no origin,—that were eternal. Love
brooded over Chaos; and the perfect
Beauty and Love, represented among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Greeks by Venus and her son, rose
from the turbid elements. It is singular
that even the ancients should have maintained
the pre-existence of Love. It
was before Order, Men, or the Gods
men worshipped. The fable suggests
the truth,—Infinite Love and Beauty
always was. It is only with their development
in finite beings that History has
to do.</p>

<p>Here <span class="smcap">Margaret</span> recapitulated. The
Indomitable Will had dethroned Time,
and, acting with Productive Energy,—variously
represented at different times by
Isis, Rhea, Ceres, Persephone, and so on,—had
driven back the sensual passions
to the bowels of the earth, while it produced
Perfect Wisdom, Genius, Beauty,
and Love, results which were more excellent
if not more powerful than their Cause.</p>

<p>To understand this Mythology, we
must denationalize ourselves, and throw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the mind back to the consideration of
Greek Art, Literature, and Poesy. It
is only scanty justice that my pen can
render to Margaret’s eloquent talk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank Shaw</span> asked her how she imagined
these personifications to have
suggested themselves in that barbarous
age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> objected to the word <em>barbarous</em>.
She believed that in the age of
Plato the human intellect reached a
point as elevated in some respects as
any it had ever touched.</p>

<p>But the Gods were not the product of
that age, but of another far more remote,
<span class="smcap">Frank</span> objected. Was not the infinity of
Hindu conception impaired, when the
Greeks attributed to the Gods the duties,
passions, and criminal indulgences of
men?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ripley</span> said that the virtue of the
Hindu lay in contemplation. If a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
had seen <em>God</em>, he was exempt from the
ordinary obligations of life, and allowed
to pass his life in quiet adoration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> added that the Greek knew
better than that. <em>He</em> felt the necessity
of developing the Infinite through action,
and embodied this necessity in his art
and poesy as well as in his myths.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span> seemed still to think that in
losing the adoring contemplation of the
Hindu, and bringing their deities to the
human level, the Greeks had taken one
step down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> had always thought it had
been a step <em>up</em>, and <span class="smcap">Ann Clarke</span> thought
that the Greeks forgot themselves,
merged all remembrance of the Finite,
in realizing the individual forces of the
Infinite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William White</span>, who had not waded
very far into the stream, thought the
North American Indian’s worship of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Manitou purer than the Greek worship,
for the very reason that the Indian
ascribed to his Manitou no passion that
had degraded humanity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said that the Indian propitiated
his God by vile deeds, by ignoble
treacheries and revenge. So the Hindu
throws her child into the Ganges, and
an ecstatic crowd falls before the car
of Juggernaut.</p>

<p>I thought a good deal, but did not
speak. Did not William’s question grow
out of the simple Unity of the Indian
worship? But the Indian does not
worship the Manitou because he recognizes
a single First Cause, comprehending
in itself all beauty, wisdom, purity,
and truth, but because his heart is
naturally lifted toward an unknown
something, which he has hardly yet
considered as a Cause. The Greek recognized
the abstract forces of the Universe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
but did not perceive their Unity,
and so personified them separately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> suggested that the Indian had
no literature, and had left no record of
his Olympus!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> added that, if we compare
the Indian Elysium with the Greek, the
difference in spirituality is perceived at
once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henry Hedge</span> said that Frank Shaw
talked about Greek mythi, but nobody
could show a purely Greek mythos.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span> replied that he only meant
that when the Greek mind had acted on
a myth, it had not refined it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> added that it was a vulgar
notion that the Poets of Greece created
her Gods; that the Poets were objective,
and could give only humanized representations
of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henry Hedge</span> thought that there was
a point to which philosophy aided and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
prompted the creative power, but, that
point passed, rather checked its action.
Analysis took the place of the objective
tendency.</p>

<p>Well! said <span class="smcap">William White</span>, would
not the human mind, aided only by culture,
be incapable of any better idea than
Frank Shaw suggested? Must not revelation
complete the work?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said that the answer to his
question would be determined by his
understanding of the word “revelation.”
<em>She</em> could not believe in a God who
had ever left himself without a witness
in the world. As soon as the human
mind and will were ready, there was
always some great Truth waiting to be
submitted to their united action, until
it was worn out. The beautiful Greek
era had been succeeded by a period of
inaction; the Roman era by another, and
so on. She was sorry we had wandered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
from our subject so far as to doubt her
very premises!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span> said, everything rested on those
premises; so he thought that the ideals
of beauty, love, justice, and truth should
be referred to the Infinite Mind, and not
to the Greek.</p>

<p>I wonder where he was when Margaret
told about the Love which “was” before
Order!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henry Hedge</span> said that Culture was
the Mediator between the Finite and
the Infinite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James Freeman Clarke</span>, alluding to
Mr. Hedge’s previous remark upon the
growth of philosophy, and the loss of
the creative power, said that if that were
a fact, it greatly diminished the probability
of the birth of pure Genius into
the world. Plato wrote when philosophy
was at the turning point.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said that there were many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
proofs in Plato that the philosophers
understood the personifications of the
mythi. She thought that the gods, the
demigods, and the heroes of mythology
represented distinct classes, and that this
was not sufficiently remembered. She
referred to the story of the burning of
Hercules in Ovid, where Jupiter calls
Juno to see how well his son endures!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William White</span> said that he thought
the idea of Deity was degraded when the
Greeks changed a hero into a god; but if
Culture be a Mediator, would not Plato
have been greater had he been born into
the nineteenth century?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James F. Clarke</span> said Platos were impossible
now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> agreed, and said that the
pride of knowledge which he would find
in the world should he appear, would be
a greater obstacle than superstition once
was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Did somebody say a little while ago that
Will indomitable was born of obstacle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> told William White that
Coleridge had once said that he could
neither measure nor understand Plato’s
ignorance! His mind had not reached
that altitude!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henry Hedge</span>, not willing to forego
the possible birth of Genius, asked if
all the experience and discovery with
which the world had been enriched since
Plato’s time would not furnish enough
for the new-comer to act upon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> replied that the mind could
not receive unless excited. She must
go through all the intellectual experience
of a Plato, to be as great as he; but
she might stand upon the general or
even her own intuitive recognition of
the truths he had advanced, and go forward
to greater results,—but still that
would not be to make herself greater.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>But, said <span class="smcap">Mrs. Ripley</span>, in the first
case you would be nothing <em>but</em> Plato.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> acceded, but begged not
to be understood as doubting that the
future would be capable of finer things
than the past.</p>

<p>The ideal significance of the Mythology
was further dwelt upon, and
much was said of the contrast between
the thought of the priest and the worship
of the people. It was acknowledged
as a matter of course, that only a
few preserved any consciousness of the
original significance of the Mythology.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henry Hedge</span> thought that this was
the true key to the purpose of the
Eleusinian mysteries, whether in Egypt
where they originated, or in Greece
where they were introduced. Through
them, all who chose became initiated into
the interior meaning of the Mythology.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Wheeler</span> added, that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the flourishing times of the Athenian
Republic every citizen was compelled
to initiate himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> closed our talk with a
gentle reproof to our wandering wits.
To prevent such desultory prattling, she
desired that a subject should be proposed
for the next evening. The story
of Ceres or Rhea, in fact the Productive
Energy however manifested, carried general
favor, and Margaret said archly that
she had thought the presence of gentlemen
(who had never until now attended
one of her talks) would prevent the
wandering and keep us free from prejudice!</p>

<p>I thought she was rightly disappointed.</p>

<p>I cannot recall the words, but at some
time this evening Margaret distinguished
three mythological dynasties. The first
was the reign of the Natural Powers.
The second, represented by Jupiter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Pluto, and Neptune, stood for the height,
the depth, and the surface or flow of
things, the first manifestations of human
consciousness. The third was the Bacchic,
Bacchus not being yet, in her estimation,
the vulgar God of the wine-vat
and the festival, but the inspired Genius,—being
to Apollo, as she said, what the
nectar is to the grape.</p>

<h2 id="II">II.</h2>

<p class="right"><i>March 8, 1841.</i></p>

<p>Margaret recapitulated the statements
she made last week. By thus
giving to each fabled Deity its place in
the scheme of Mythology, she did not
mean to ignore the enfolding ideas, the
one thought developed in all—as in
Rhea, Bacchus, Pan. She would only
imply that each personification was individual,
served a particular purpose, and
was worshipped in a particular way.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to talk about Ceres,
she wished to remind us of the mischief
of wandering from our subject. She
hoped the ground she offered would be
accepted <em>at least to talk about</em>! Certainly
no one could deny that a mythos was
the last and best growth of a national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
mind, and that in this case the characteristics
of the Greek mind were best
gathered from this creation.</p>

<p>Ceres, Persephone, and Isis, as well as
Rhea, Diana, and so on, seem to be only
modifications of one enfolding idea,—a
goddess accepted by all nations, and not
peculiar to Greece. The pilgrimages of
the more prominent of these goddesses,
Ceres and Isis, seem to indicate the
life which loses what is dear in childhood,
to seek in weary pain for what
after all can be but half regained. Ceres
regained her daughter, but only for half
the year. Isis found her husband, but
dismembered. This era in Mythology
seems to mark the progress of a people
from an unconscious to a conscious state.
Persephone’s periodical exile shows the
impossibility of resuming an unconsciousness
from which we have been once
aroused, the need thought has, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
once felt the influence of the Seasons, to
retire into itself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Wheeler</span> reminded Margaret
that she had said that the predominant
goddesses, without reference to
Greece, enfolded only one idea, that of
the female <em>Will</em> or <em>Genius</em>,—<em>the bounteous
giver</em>. He had asked her if she could
sustain herself by etymological facts,
and she replied that her knowledge of
the Greek was not critical enough.
Since then he had inquired into the
origin of the proper names of the Greek
deities, and found that it confirmed her
impression. The names of Rhea, Tellus,
Isis, and Diana were resolvable into one,
and the difference in their etymology was
only a common and permissible change
in the position of the letters of which
they are composed, or a mere provincial
dialectic change. Diana is the same as
Dione, also one of the names of Juno.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> asked if Homer ever confounded
the last two? <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>
thought not. Homer was purely objective.
He knew little and cared less
about the primitive creation of the
myths.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. W. Emerson</span> thought it would be
very difficult to detect this secret. Jupiter,
for instance, might have been a
man who was the exponent of Will to
his race.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said, “No; they could have
deduced him just as easily from Nature
herself, or from a single exhibition of
will power.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. W. Emerson</span> said that a man
like Napoleon would easily have suggested
it.</p>

<p>“What a God-send is a Napoleon!”
exclaimed <span class="smcap">Charles Wheeler</span>; “let us
pray for scores of such, that a new and
superior mythos may arise for us!” Is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
it malicious to suspect a subtle irony
turned against the sacred person of
R. W. E. in this speech?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> retorted indignantly that if
they came, <em>we</em> should do nothing better
than write memoirs of their hats, coats,
and swords, as we had done already,
without thinking of any lesson they
might teach. She could not see why
we were not content to take the beautiful
Greek mythi as they were, without
troubling ourselves about those which
might arise for us!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. W. E.</span> acknowledged that the
Greeks had a quicker perception of the
beautiful than we. Their genius lay in
the material expression of it. If we
knew the real meaning of the names of
their Deities, the story would take to
flight. We should have only the working
of abstract ideas as we might adjust
them for ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said that a fable was more
than a mere word. It was a word of
the purest kind rather, the passing of
thought into form. R. W. E. had made
no allowance for time or space or climate,
and there was a want of truth in that.
The age of the Greeks was the age of
Poetry; ours was the age of Analysis.
<em>We</em> could not create a Mythology.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emerson</span> asked, “Why not? We had
still better material.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said, irrelevantly as it
seemed to me, that Carlyle had attempted
to deduce new principles from present
history, and that was the reason he did
not <em>respect</em> the <em>respectable</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emerson</span> said Carlyle was unfortunate
in his figures, but we might have mythology
as beautiful as the Greek.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> thought each age of the
world had its own work to do. The
transition of thought into form marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the Greek period. It was most easily
done through fable, on account of their
intense perception of beauty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emerson</span> pursued his own train of
thought. He seemed to forget that we
had come together to pursue Margaret’s.
He said it was impossible that men or
events should <em>stand out</em> in a population
of twenty millions as they could from a
population of a single million, to which
the whole population of the ancient
world could hardly have amounted. As
Hercules stood to Greece, no modern
man could ever stand in relation to his
own world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> thought Hercules and Jupiter
quite different creations. The first
<em>might</em> have been a deified life. The
second could not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Wheeler</span> said that R. W.
E.’s view carried no historical obligation
of belief with it. We could not deny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the heroic origin of the Greek demigods,
but the highest dynasty was the
exponent of translated thought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophia Ripley</span> asked if the life of an
individual fitly interwoven with her
experience was not as fine a Poem as
the story of Ceres, her wanderings and
her tears? Did not Margaret know such
lives?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. W. E.</span> thought every man had
probably met his Jupiter, Juno, Minerva,
Venus, or Ceres in society!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> was sure she never had!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. W. E.</span> explained: “Not in the
world, but each on his own platform.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Story</span> objected. The life
of an individual was not universal.
(!)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophia Ripley</span> repeated, “The inner
life.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Story</span> claimed to be an individual,
and did not think individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
experience could ever meet all minds,—like
the story of Ceres, for example.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophia</span> said all experience was universal.</p>

<p>I said nothing, but held this colloquy
with myself. Thought is the best of
human nature; its fulness urges expression:
its need of being met, not only by
<em>one</em> other but by every other, <em>craves</em> it.
This craving is the acknowledgment of
the universal experience. What is <em>purely</em>
individual is perishable. <em>Identity</em> is to
be separated from individuality for this
cause.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said the element of beauty
would be wanting to our creations. A
fine emotion glowed through features
which seem to fall like a soft veil over
the soul, while it could scarce do more
than animate those that were obtuse and
coarse in every outline. (!)</p>

<p>“Then,” said <span class="smcap">William Story</span>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
my heart thanked the <i lang="fr">preux chevalier</i>,—“then
something is wanting in the
emotion itself.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William White</span> said, stupidly, that
sunlight could not fall with equal charm
on rocks and the green grass. (!)</p>

<p>I asked if the rock could not give
what it did not receive? Flung back by
rugged points and relieved by dark
shadows, was not the sunlight itself
transfigured?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Story</span> said every face had its own
beauty. No act that was natural could
be ungraceful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emerson</span> said that we all did sundry
graceful acts, in our caps and tunics,
which we never could do again, which
we never wanted to do again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said, at last we had touched
the point. We could not restore the
childhood of the world, but could we not
admire this simple plastic period, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
gather from it some notion of the Greek
genius?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. W. E.</span> thought this legitimate. He
would have it that we could not determine
the origin of a mythos, but we
might fulfil Miss Fuller’s intention.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said history reconciled us
to life, by showing that man had redeemed
himself. Genius needed that
encouragement.</p>

<p>Not <em>Genius</em>, <span class="smcap">Sophia Ripley</span> thought;
common natures needed it, but Genius
was self-supported.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said it might be the consolation
of Genius.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Russell</span> asked why Miss Fuller
found so much fault with the present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> <em>had</em> no fault to find with
it. She took facts as they were. Every
age did something toward fulfilling the
cycle of mind. The work of the Greeks
was not ours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophia Ripley</span> asked if the mythology
had been a prophecy of the Greek mind
to itself, or if the nation had experienced
life in any wide or deep sense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> seemed a little out of
patience, and no wonder! She said it
did not matter which. The question
was, what could <em>we find</em> in the mythi,
and what did the Greeks mean that we
should find there. Coleridge once said
that certain people were continually saying
of Shakespeare, that he did not mean
to impart certain spiritual meanings to
some of his sketches of life and character;
but if Shakespeare did not mean it
his Genius did: so if the Greeks meant not
this or that, the Greek genius meant it.</p>

<p>In relation to the progress of the ages,
<span class="smcap">James F. Clarke</span> said that the story of
Persephone concealed in the bowels of
the earth for half the year seemed to
him to indicate something of their comparative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
states. Persephone was the
seed which must return to earth before
it could fructify. Thought must retire
into itself before it can be regenerate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> was pleased with this, more
especially as in the story of the Goddess
it is eating the pomegranate, whose seed
is longest in germinating, which dooms
her to the realm of Pluto.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George Ripley</span> remarked that we
saw this need of withdrawal in the slothful
ages when mind seemed to be imbibing
energy for future action. The world
sometimes forsook a quest and returned
to it. We had forsaken Beauty, but we
might return to it.</p>

<p>Certainly, <span class="smcap">Margaret</span> assented. A
perfect mind would detect all beauty in
the hearth-rug at her feet: the meanest
part of creation contained the whole;
but the labor we were now at to appreciate
the Greek proved conclusively that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
<em>we</em> were not Greek. A simple plastic
nature would take it all in with delight,
without doubt or question.</p>

<p>Or rather, amended <span class="smcap">Emerson</span>, would
take it up and go forward with it.</p>

<p>It makes no difference, said <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>,
for we live in a circle.</p>

<p>I did not think it pleasant to track
and retrack the same arc, and preferred
to go forward with R. W. E., so I asked
if there was to be no <em>higher</em> poetry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> acknowledged that there
was something beyond the aspiration
of the Egyptian or the poetry of the
Greek.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George Ripley</span> thought we had not
lost all reverence for these abstract
forces. The Eleusinian mysteries might
be forgotten, but not Ceres. We did not
worship in ignorance. The mysteries led
back to the Infinite. The processes of
vegetation were actually heart-rending!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Here, <em>I</em> thought, was a basis for my
higher poetry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George Ripley</span> acknowledged that it
was so. He seemed to be more conscious
of the movement of the world than
any of our party. He said we must not
measure creation by Boston and Washington,
as we were too apt to do. There
was still France, Germany, and Prussia,—perhaps
Russia! The work of this generation
was not religious nor poetic; still,
there was a tendency to go back to both.
There were to be ultraisms, but also, he
hoped, consistent development.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Wheeler</span> then related the
story of Isis, of her hovering in the form
of a swallow round the tree in which
the sarcophagus of Osiris had been enclosed
by Typhon; of her being allowed
to fell the tree; of the odor emitted by
the royal maidens whom she touched,
which revealed her Divinity to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Queen; of the second loss of the body,
as she returned home, and its final dismemberment.</p>

<p>There was little success in spiritualizing
more of this story than the pilgrimage,
and R. W. E. seemed to feel this; for
when <span class="smcap">Margaret</span> had remarked that even
a divine force must become as the birds
of the air to compass its ends, and that
it was in the carelessness of conscious
success that the second loss occurred, he
said that it was impossible to detect an
inner sense in all these stories.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> replied, that she had not
attempted that, but she could see it
in all the prominent points.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Wheeler</span> said that the varieties
of anecdote proved that the stories
were not all authentic. It was an ancient
custom to strike off medals in
honor of certain acts of the Gods. To
these graven pictures the common people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
gave their own vulgar interpretations,
as they did also to the bas-reliefs on
their temples and monuments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> said this accounted for many
of the stories transmitted by Homer.
When sculpture and architecture had
lost their meaning, his inventive genius
was only the more stimulated to find
one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Wheeler</span> asked what Margaret
would make of the story that the
tears of Isis frightened children to
death?</p>

<p>There was a general laugh, but <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>
said coolly, that children always
shrank from a baffled hope.</p>

<p>Some one contrasted Persephone with
her mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> assented to whatever was
said, and added that she had been particularly
struck with it in an engraving
she had recently seen, in which Ceres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
stood with lifted eyes, full-eyed, matronly,
bounteous, ready to give all to
all, while Persephone, dejected and
thoughtful, sat meditating; and the idea
was strengthened by her discovering
that Persephone was the same as Ariadne
the deserted. I could only guess at the
remark by Margaret’s comment. It
seemed to imply baffled hope for
Persephone.</p>

<p>The Eleusinian mysteries were now
alluded to. Although it has been said
that only moral precepts were inculcated
through these, <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span> urged that a
whole school of Continental authors now
acknowledged that the higher doctrines
of philosophy were taught.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. W. E.</span> added, that as initiation became
more easy such instruction must
have degenerated into a mere matter of
form, and many of the <em>un</em>initiated surpass
the initiated in wisdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> admitted this. Socrates
was one of the uninitiated. The crowd
seldom felt the full force of beauty in
Art or Literature. To prove it, it was
only necessary to walk once through the
Hall of Sculpture at the Athenæum, and
catch the remarks of any half-dozen on
Michael Angelo’s “Day and Night.”
He would be fortunate who heard a
single observer comment on its power.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Russell</span> asked why the images
of the sun and moon were introduced
into these mysterious celebrations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> asked impatiently why
they had always been invoked by every
child who could string two rhymes
together.</p>

<p>I said that if Ceres was the simple
<em>agricultural</em> productive energy, of course
the sun was her first minister, its genial
influence being as manifest as the energy
itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>In regard to the etymology of the
proper names, it seemed reasonable to
me that this energy should have gained
attributes as it did names. Any nation
devoted to the chase would learn to call
the lunar deity Diana; any devoted to
the cultivation of grain would project
her as Ceres. The reproductive powers
of flocks and herds would suggest Rhea
or Juno, and philosophy or art would
invoke Persephone.</p>

<p>When we were talking about beauty,
J. F. C. quoted Goethe, and said that the
spirit sometimes made a mistake and
clothed itself in the wrong garment.</p>

<h2 id="III">III.</h2>

<p>The third conversation was delayed
by Margaret’s illness, and finally took
place—</p>

<p class="right"><i>March 19, 1841.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> again complained that we
wandered from the subject, and told the
following story from Novalis.</p>

<p>Imagine a room, on one side of it Eros
and Fable at play. On the other, before
a marble slab on which rests a vase of pure
water, sits a fair woman named Sophia.
Her head rests upon her hand. Between
her and the children sits a man of reverend
age, before a table at which he
writes whatever has been or is. This is
History; and as he finishes each sheet
he hands it to Sophia, who dips it in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
vase of pure water, from which it often
emerges a perfect blank. Sometimes a
few lines, at others a few words, sometimes
only a punctuation mark, survive
the test. This troubles the old man. At
last he rises and leaves the room. Fable
springs to his vacant seat, and scribbles
as if in play till his return, when History
reproves her for wasting the paper, and
passes the sheet to Sophia, when, lo! it
comes out from her vase unchanged.
Fable has borne the test of Truth. History
is enraged at this, and succeeds in
driving both Sophia and Fable from their
home, unfairly. Sophia is driven away,
but the child escapes by a back door, and,
becoming bewildered in the central caverns
of the Earth, falls into the power of
the Fates.</p>

<p>These respectable old ladies find the
little Fable very troublesome, and, after
some scolding, send her away to spin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
when, lo! from the recesses of the cavern
all sorts of wonders and strange shapes
are spun out. The Fates are frightened,
and they seek History to learn in what
manner they may best rid themselves
of the intruder. However much they
may dislike her, she is under their protection,
and History can do no more
than advise them to send her out to
catch Tarantulas! Fable departs and
meets Eros, who gives her a lyre, upon
which she plays, and the venomous insects
swarm about her. The Fates behold
her return unharmed! They had hoped
she would be stung to death, and in
despair Ate throws her scissors at the
child, who gracefully avoids them. Hereupon
the Tarantulas sting the Fates in
the feet, at which they begin to dance.
As their clothes are thick and heavy,
this is rather inconvenient exercise, and
when Fable laughs at their distress they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
send her away to spin them some thin
dresses. Fable is tired of wandering.
She plays upon her lyre to the Tarantulas,
bidding them spin, and she will give
them three large flies. When the dresses
are done, she carries them immediately
to the Fates, who begin again to dance.
The ends of the threads are still in the
bodies of the Tarantulas, who do not like
to be jerked about. “Behold the flies
which I promised you,” said Fable.</p>

<p>Thereupon the Tarantulas fall upon
the dancing Fates, and a new dynasty
commences, in which Eros reigns, with
Fable for prime minister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said that in the story she
had told she had set us the example
of wandering from the subject, but she
hoped to some purpose. She hoped no
one would have need to call upon little
Fable’s body-guard of Tarantulas.</p>

<p>The subject of the evening was Apollo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
in contrast with Ceres, or Genius opposed
to Productive Energy. The history of
Apollo stood for the history of thought,
its progressive development and its unhappiness.
All the loves of Apollo are
miserable. He never labors for himself.
He uses the instruments which others
have shaped. He is so delighted with
the lyre, which Mercury, that is Sagacity,
has made, that he gives him the
divining-rod, and would give him more,
but he cannot. The earnest simplicity
with which Apollo begs Mercury to swear
by the sacred Styx not to steal his
quiver or his darts is beautiful! The
common understanding, mere human
sagacity, may indeed lay hands on the
weapons of the Inspired One, but it cannot
possess them. The ray, the dart,
the quiver, of Apollo all stand for the
instantaneous power of thought.</p>

<p>Delphi did not originally belong to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Apollo. With the aid of Bacchus, he
wrested it from Terra, Neptune, and
Themis; hence the name “Delphi,” or
“The brothers.” This is only another
instance of his independence. All things
are made to his hand. The great contrast
between Ceres and Apollo lies in
the success of each. Ceres is always
full, always prepared to meet the call
of humanity. Apollo is always unsatisfied.
He transmutes whatever he
touches, as he did one of his many loves,
changed to a bay-tree. His changes are
always beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James F. Clarke</span> asked how Margaret
would explain the fraternal relation between
Bacchus and Apollo.</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember?” she retorted.
“I don’t like to repeat it, it is so smart
and ingenious!” Apollo and Bacchus
seemed to her the question and the
response. Bacchus was what the earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
yielded to the touch of Genius. The
grape was genial. It typified the excess
of the earth’s fruitfulness. Bacchus
avenges the wrongs of Apollo, who is
said never to have seen a shadow! He
never perceives an obstacle, but instantly
destroys an alien nature. Whatever
opposed Apollo met with terrible retribution,—if
not from himself, then from
others. Genius cannot endure the presence
of anything that mocks at it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Wheeler</span> said something
about the flaying of Marsyas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said that this once seemed
to her the most shocking of cruelties,
but she had lately seen a picture which
reconciled her to the deed! After looking
at the self-complacent face of Marsyas,
she did not wonder that Apollo
destroyed him. She longed to <em>see him
do it</em>! Apollo was never indignant at
any sublime treachery. He forgave Mercury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
his theft because it was god-like,
because he did it so well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Russell</span> said ironically that the
destruction of the children of Niobe must
have been a gratifying sight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> laughed, and said, “That is
like being reminded of the ‘poor mariner,’
when I say that I like to hear the
wind blow.” The indignation of Apollo
seemed to her one of his noblest attributes.
His perfect purity separated him
from all the Gods. Ceres seemed to be
included in the idea of many other Gods,
as in Pan, Bacchus, Juno, and Isis; but
Apollo, the divine Genius, stands alone.
There is none like him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henry Hedge</span> asked whether holiness
appertained to Apollo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> thought not. Holiness
supposed a voluntary consecration of
one’s self, but there was no need of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
in Apollo. He was pure thought, consecrated,
but not consciously.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henry Hedge</span> said he had asked, because,
considering Jesus to have, as he
certainly had, a mythological character,
he thought there was a resemblance
between him and Apollo. His own
words justified the idea,—“I am the
light of the world,” and so on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Russell</span> asked suddenly why
Apollo’s lyre had seven strings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said seven was a consecrated
number.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Russell</span> asked if it did not have
to do with the seven planets?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George Ripley</span> said there were not
so many in that day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> liked the reason, and wished
she had thought of it herself!</p>

<p>Some one asked about the connection
between Diana and Apollo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said that Genius needed a
sister to console him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emerson</span> asked what bearing the inscription
over the Delphic temple had
upon the story of Apollo,—the Divine
pun EI, which means equally “Thou
art” and “If,”—as grand a pun as that
of him who, dying, said he was going to
see the great “Perhaps”!—“le grand
peut-être.”</p>

<p>Better translated, I thought, as the
great “May-be.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George Ripley</span> asked if it were not
generally accepted positively as “Thou
art”?</p>

<p>“Probably,” <span class="smcap">Mr. Emerson</span> said.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henry Hedge</span> found another type of
the Apollo in the Egyptian Horus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Russell</span> asked if the two Greek
vowels had not once stood for Isis and
Osiris. If so, they would have a natural
connection with the oracle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>I remembered the inscription on the
statue of Isis, “I am all that has been
and that shall be, and none among mortals
has taken off my veil.” The “I
am” of the Jews, and the “Thou art”
of the Delphic temple are epigrammatic,
but the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emerson</span>, replying somewhat curtly
to Mrs. Russell, said there were various
explanations.</p>

<p>The story of Phaeton came next.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henry Hedge</span> asked how Presumption
should be the child of Genius.</p>

<p>“Genius must be self-confident,” Margaret
said, “and that might predominate.”</p>

<p>I asked if real Genius did not know
its own resources and husband them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> thought Genius often attempted
more than it could do.</p>

<p>I said a man might have genius and
presume, but that if <em>he were a genius</em> I
should expect him to be modest. Still,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
as it must have a crowd of imitators, it
might become the father of presumption.
The substance creates the shadow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Story</span> said no product could
be as great as the producing power; but
that did not seem to me to touch the
point, for the question was not whether
Apollo could not give birth to something
less than himself, but whether the
possession of power could create an unfounded
claim to it.</p>

<p>The story of Latona followed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henry Hedge</span> said that the word
meant concealment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> thought this very expressive,
and said that the isolation which
Goethe and other geniuses had been
craving since the world began Apollo
had no need to seek. His mother was
concealment. The oracle was then discussed,—how
it was possible to consult
it many times and receive each time a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
different answer,—how it could be
bribed, as by Alexander, or would give
two answers in one; but nothing very
new was said.</p>

<p>I remembered the double answer of
the Pythoness to Crœsus when he meditated
crossing the Halys. “Thou shalt
destroy a great empire,” she said. He
thought it was the enemy’s: fate decided
it should be his own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophia Ripley</span> thought the oracle
belonged to Wisdom rather than Genius.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said Minerva dwelt in
men’s houses. It was necessary a voice
from Heaven should speak.</p>

<p>Some one wondered that Jupiter had
not possessed himself of the oracle, which
led <span class="smcap">Margaret</span> back to her exponents,
and she confessed that she was not quite
satisfied with her own definition of Jupiter
as Will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emerson</span> suggested that experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
was a prominent feature in the Jupiter,
and named him Character.</p>

<p>Character is educated Will, said <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>,
hesitating, and paused, for the
term did not suit her.</p>

<p>Juno was then spoken of as passive
Will, and her traits were dwelt upon. It
is amusing to see how weak the Queen
of Olympus can be in opposition to its
King. The peacock was probably made
sacred to her on account of the beauty
of its plumage, while the eagle was consecrated
to Jupiter on account of its
strength.</p>

<p>I said that the peacock, strutting with
conceit, glancing at its ill-shaped feet
and vexed enough to bawl in consequence,
easily suggested the scolding
Juno.</p>

<p>Some one asked a question about Æsculapius.
<span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said he was genius
made practical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henry Hedge</span> thought that Apollo
by his own connection with the healing
art became the symbol of physical life
and beauty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Story</span> thought no statue
could bear comparison with the Apollo
Belvedere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> preferred the Antinous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James Clarke</span> asked why Art should
present a so much more inspiring view
of Greek Mythology than Poetry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said that all her ideas of it
were deduced from Art. She did not
profess to know much of the Greek
authors, and depended chiefly upon
Homer, but wished that some of the
gentlemen who ought to know more
would speak.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Story</span> thought it was because
the poets wrote for popular applause,
for recitation and its immediate
effect. Sculptors labored more purely
for their Art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>I thought too that the dramatists
often had a political aim, and manœuvred
Olympus to suit it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James Clarke</span> said that if in our
time every public speaker must bend
to his audience to a degree, it was still
more necessary in Greece.</p>

<p>We were told to consider Minerva
for the next conversation, and to write
down our thoughts about her. For my
part I don’t like using Latin names for
Greek deities. It greatly confuses my
ideas. Jupiter and Zeus seem very different
to me.</p>

<p>In regard to the story that Apollo
never saw a shadow, <span class="smcap">Caroline Sturgis</span>
asked how Apollo could destroy an alien
nature if he never met it.</p>

<p>There was quite an unsatisfactory
talk about this, which would have ended
had anybody remembered how the sun
solves the enigma every day. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
sun never sees the shadow it destroys.
When its rays fall, light is. It annihilates
the alien by merely being. So
Truth annihilates Falsehood, yet cannot
meet it. The two are never in one
presence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> opened our talk by saying
that the subject of Wisdom presented
more conversable points than that of
Genius. We could all think and talk
about Wisdom, and any man who had
ever scratched his finger was to a degree
wise.</p>

<p>Minerva was the child of Counsel and
Intelligent Will. She had no infancy,
but sprang full-armed into being. Ready,
agile, she was in herself the history of
thought. She did not need that her
life should be one of incident. Her
attendant emblems are expressive: the
Sphinx, the owl, the serpent, the cock,
and the javelin suggest her whole story.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William White</span> asked why Genius
was masculine and Wisdom feminine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> thought no one could find
any difficulty in the fact that Genius
was masculine. It presented itself to
the mind in the full glow of power.
The very outlines of the feminine form
were yielding, and we could not associate
them with a prominent, self-conscious
state of the faculties. Wisdom was like
woman, always ready for the fight if
necessary, yet never going to it; taking
reality as a basis, and classifying and arranging
upon it all that Genius creates,—seeing
the relations and proper values
of things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George Ripley</span> objected to this definition.
He might have imbibed a Hebrew
idea, but the office of Wisdom was
surely something more than this,—a
purely mechanical and orderly tact.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said she had not meant to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
give <em>our</em> view of it, only the Greek idea
as manifest in the story of Minerva. To
William White she said, smiling, that
she supposed he had not wondered so
much that Genius should be masculine
as that Wisdom should be feminine!
But the Greeks were wise, and she
revered their keen perception.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elisabeth Hoar</span> said it seemed to
her that Wisdom provided <em>means</em>. A
hero might be inspired by Genius, but
Wisdom provided his armor, taught him
to distinguish the goal, and to perceive
clearly the relation to it of any onward
step.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> agreed to this, and</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Story</span> said that Genius
was indebted to Wisdom for <em>means
of communication</em>. Genius thinks words
impertinent, but Wisdom apprehends
its intuitions, and gives them shape.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said further, that Wisdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
must adopt instinctively the finest
medium.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that Wisdom not
only gave power of communication, but
power of attainment. Walter Scott was
a good instance of the union of intuitive
perception and human sagacity, but all
these words about it cleared up nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> then proposed that we
should take up the attributes of Minerva,
and so get at the facts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Ripley</span> did not think it noble
enough when she based Wisdom upon
realities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Story</span> said Wisdom must
have something to work upon. He
thought Wisdom compared the intuitions
of Genius with realities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Wheeler</span> thought the word
<em>actual</em> would help them out of their
difficulty.</p>

<p>I wanted to quote Emerson to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
effect that the Ideal is more Real than
the Actual.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> agreed with Mr. Wheeler,
and said that by reality she understood
anything incarnated,—whatever was
tangible. She then went on to speak
of the Sphinx. What was it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elisabeth Hoar</span> seemed surprised at
the question. Was it not one thing to
everybody?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> called for her idea, but she
would not give it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said that to herself it represented
the development of a thought,
founding itself upon the animal, until it
grew upward into calm, placid power.
She revered these good ancients, who
did not throw away any of the gifts of
God; who were neither materialists nor
immaterialists, but who made matter
always subservient to the highest ends
of the Spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">William White</span> asked if the festivals
of the Gods, the highest source of their
influence over the people, did not show
how little they had penetrated to the
spirit of things?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> thought ambrosia and nectar
were proper emblems of Divine
Joy. They were not to be taken
literally.</p>

<p>“But,” persisted <span class="smcap">White</span>, “the great
body of the people thought them so.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Story</span> said, with happy
grace, that the great <em>body</em> of the people
might be excused for such a thought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> enjoyed the pun, and said
that the great Greek body was sensuous
and ate, but that the Greek soul knew
better than to suspect the Gods of opening
their mouths.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> waked up at this moment,
and asked what Margaret would say
to Berkeley’s theory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said she did not know what
it was!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> said, the evolution of all
things from the soul, the non-existence
of matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James P. Clarke</span> thought it very
difficult to decide how far spirit and
matter were one. A man’s identity was
not in the particles which came and
went every seven years, but in the spirit.
Yet these particles constituted the wall
of separation between himself and others.
His identity was in his spirit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George Ripley</span> begged leave to disagree.
He thought we knew as much
about matter as about spirit, and that
Berkeley’s theory was as good as any.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said that if God created
matter, of course it was evolved from
spirit; that matter could not be antagonistic
to that from which it was evolved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
To express a complete idea, we had only
to say, “Jehovah, I am.”</p>

<p>“Or,” <span class="smcap">Charles Wheeler</span> added, “to
be silent.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>, “and in that
lies the merit of Mythology. Every
faculty was, according to that, an incomplete
statement. Therefore Mr. Ripley
did wrong to confound Minerva with the
Logos.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> did not see that Berkeley’s
statement was answered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Story</span> came in with another
pun. “If Berkeley thought so, it was
<em>no matter</em>!”</p>

<p>Some stupid person spoiled the wit by
trying to explain it, and the question
remained to us just as much matter as
ever.</p>

<p>They talked about the Sphinx again,
yet said little. It holds more meaning
in its passive womb than talk will ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
play the midwife to. It was the child of
the Destructive Element and Feeling,—Typhon
and Echidna,—the human
heart experienced in misfortune touched
by death. Thought rooted in the actual
and developed by tenderness was rooted
in this figure.</p>

<p>“Everybody knows that Wisdom
stings,” said <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>, and so we went
on to the serpent.</p>

<p>Somebody spoke of the Greek Tartarus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ida Russell</span> thought its torment was
not acute, but consisted of the deprivation
of comforts.</p>

<p>The wandering idleness of it would be
intolerable to an active Greek, <span class="smcap">Elisabeth Hoar</span>
thought, but more endurable
than any device of a priesthood. As
for our serpent, no one seemed to know
much about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said that we owed it so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
much, that <em>she</em> felt in duty bound to
know something of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James F. Clarke</span> said that the Christian
serpent was quite another thing.</p>

<p>Everybody laughed at the idea of a
<em>Christian</em> serpent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William White</span> professed great admiration
for the reptile. We should
have had no Christianity but for its
beguiling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> agreed!—and said she
supposed everybody felt that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Russell</span> thought the casting of
the skin very expressive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James F. Clarke</span> gave Coleridge’s
exposition, to the effect that the serpent
was the common understanding! It
would touch and handle all things, and
even sought to be as the Gods, knowing
good from evil. Its undulating motion—its
belly now on the ground, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
off—expressed both the aspiration and the
subserviency of the creature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> asked if serpents ever swallowed
their own tails?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Wheeler</span> said that must be
an arbitrary form.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> replied, that she had been
struck by the difference between the
Mexican and the Greek serpent. The
Mexican was folded back upon itself.</p>

<p>Not always, I said. Its tail is sometimes
in its mouth, and the variations
seem to be occasioned by the architectural
necessity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James F. Clarke</span> spoke of a Virginia
snake that moves in a circle, and asked
if when Mr. Emerson talked about
“coming full circle” he was not thinking
of that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> laughed, and declared that
serpent must be of Yankee invention.
Æsculapius bore two on his staff, Mercury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
two on his divining-rod, and the
cock was also sacred to Æsculapius.</p>

<p>I asked if this did not indicate a certain
subjection of these Gods to Wisdom?</p>

<p>Some questions written on paper were
here read. One asked why Minerva
was born of the stroke of Vulcan, and
why she was the patroness of weavers,
and what that had to do with the story
of Arachne.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> replied with ill temper to
the first, that it was because Vulcan held
the hammer,—to the second, that she
did not know.</p>

<p>But was there really so little meaning
in the fact that Mechanic Art so ministered
to Intelligent Will that she could
afford to miss the point?</p>

<p>She said we could see that Minerva
was told to marry Vulcan, but declined;
would have nothing to do with the sooty
cripple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophia Ripley</span> said, aptly enough,
that Minerva had been changing her
mind ever since!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ida Russell</span> thought that when Mechanic
Art was married to Beauty, it
might charm even Wisdom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George Ripley</span> said she might well
have despised the brute force, but as it
grew into something more noble, have
learned to love it. Dr. Dana<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> was the
servant of the Lowell corporation. In
these days no corporation could exist
without its man of science. His salary
was a mere pittance, and when he made
a discovery with which all Europe rang,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
he asked for a part of the profits. “We
will consider,” said the soulless corporation,
and they decided that they had a
legitimate right to all that could be
made out of their servant!</p>

<p>“Thus,” I said, “Wisdom sows for
the Mechanic Art to reap?”</p>

<p>“Exactly so,” was the reply; “and
this contains the essence of the Yankee
philosophy.”</p>

<p>The life of Wisdom was one long
struggle for something beyond a merely
serviceable knowledge. Bending alike
to art and artisan, she still refused to
love the latter till he had wooed Beauty
to their common service. But Wisdom
has of late married Vulcan. He no
longer limps, and has washed his face in
the springs of love and thought, and sits
in holiday robes beside his bride.</p>

<p>Somebody said that the story of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Arachne was an instance of the Goddess’s
vindictiveness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> hoped that the vindictiveness
was a popular interpolation. If
so, the story of Marsyas shows that
she was malicious. She brought his misfortunes
upon him. If her own voice
was discordant, there was no reason why
his voice should please!</p>

<p>“Divinities have a right to be indignant,”
said somebody. Did Margaret
blush?</p>

<p>In speaking of the artistic representations
of Minerva, <span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said some
beautiful things. Minerva was as tall
and large as she could be, without being
masculine. Her face was thoughtful and
serene, without being sweet. Her eye
was so full and clear that it had no need
to be deep.</p>

<p>The talk was closed by Margaret’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
reading the Essay that E. P. P. had sent
in, and the criticisms upon it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> began by speaking of the
<em>conservatism</em> which disinclined Jupiter to
the birth of Minerva.</p>

<p>“Yes,” <span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said, “the good
was always opposed to the better.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> then spoke of the Parthenon,
upon which, according to the Homeric
Hymn, the story of Minerva’s birth was
sculptured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said it had been difficult
to believe that the Greeks would
put so ugly a thing upon their temple,
but the ruins showed a Vulcan with his
hammer in his hand, and the form of
the Goddess hovering over the cloven
skull.</p>

<p>Why, asked <span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span>, did Ulysses
represent Wisdom in the Odyssey?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> thought he represented
the history of a thought in life, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
he tired us all out with his long story,
and so pushed us to decision.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> alluded to the different conceptions
of Minerva in the Iliad and the
Odyssey, and this led to the question
of priority of composition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> thought the Odyssey was
written when Homer was young and
romantic; but E. P. P. and myself stood
out stoutly for the precedence of the
Iliad. I said, without the least bit of
real knowledge, that I should not wonder
if there were two centuries between
the poems, they seemed to indicate such
entirely different states of society; but
certainly the Odyssey was latest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Wheeler</span> said that the best
scholars seemed all of one mind. The
Iliad was written first by Homer,—the
Odyssey long after by another hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> said that there was a gem
which represented Minerva as married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to a mortal, but she could tell nothing
more about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jones Very</span> said that when Wisdom
falls into decay we call it Genius!</p>

<p>Does that mean that prophetic power
fallen back from the moral nature to
the intellect is dwarfed accordingly?</p>

<h2 id="V">V.</h2>

<p class="right"><i>April 2, 1841.</i></p>

<p>The story of Venus and Cupid and
Psyche was discussed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said that of Venus she had
less to say than of either of the preceding
Deities! She was not the expression of
a thought, but of a fact. She was the
Greek idea of a lovely woman,—the
best physical development of woman.
When we have said, “It is,” we have
said all. The birth of Beauty was the
only ideal thing about her. She sprang
from the wave, from the flux and reflux
of things, from the undulating line.
On this Venus, transitoriness had set its
seal. As we look at her, we feel that
she must change. Her loveliness is too
fair to last. Her beauty would pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
next moment. She could not live a
year, we think, without losing something
of her full grace. It was peculiarly
Greek to create a beautiful symbol, and
to pause in the symbol. The Greeks
were very apt to do this. They did it
effectually in the Goddess of Love. She
was sportive in all her amours. They
had no idea of an Everlasting Love.
They enjoyed themselves too much to
abstract themselves. Venus seemed to
Margaret a merely human creature. She
was not the type of Universal Beauty:
the Greek eye was closed to that. Still,
their own embodiment did not satisfy
their own need. They filled out their
ideal with Venus Urania, Hebe, and all
the attendant Hours and Graces, yet
were not satisfied. Then came the fable
of Psyche and her three Cupids. Venus
was only a pretty girl! Her cestus, her
doves, her pets, her jealousies, all betray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
it. The Venus Urania was more. <em>She</em>
was the child of Celestial Light. Hebe
was born of immortal bloom. To fill out
the gaps in their conception, Eros, or
Love in Sadness, Cupid a frolicsome boy,
and the more noble, more creative Love
which brooded over Chaos were evolved
from their consciousness. Psyche, who
did not appear until the age of Augustus,
who was too modern to be mythological,
yet glowing with mythic beauty, was
only another evidence of their imperfect
idea. Her story expresses more than
that of Venus. It tells not only the
story of human love, but represents the
pilgrimage of a soul. The jealousy of
Venus was that which the good must
always feel toward the better which is
to supersede it, and as soon as Psyche
looked upon her sleeping lover she became
immortal. The soul in the fulness
of Love became conscious of Destiny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">James Clarke</span> asked what was the
difference between the girl-mother—the
Madonna—and the Greek Venus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> replied, with more patience
than I was capable of, that the Madonna
represented more than passing womanly
beauty. She was prophetic, and lived
again in her child.</p>

<p>Then, persisted <span class="smcap">James F.</span>, why was
Vulcan the <em>husband</em> of Beauty, to which
Margaret gave no satisfactory answer.
He then gave his own thought, to
which I can do no justice, although it
was what I tried in vain to say at the
last conversation. It amounted to this,—that
in seeking for beauty we lose it,
but in aiming at utility through hard
labor we find perfect proportion—and
consequently perfect beauty. He said
that he and his sister Sarah had often
spoken to each other about this, and he
felt that the time would come when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
essays would be written about our ships,
as we now write essays about the Pyramids
and the Greek Art. Posterity
might find the proof of our search after
beauty in the graceful prow and swelling
hold and tall, tapering mast or shrouds
of shredded jet; in the bellying canvas
and the patron saint which watches the
wake from the stern. But we know
that the ship, the most beautiful object
in our modern world, was the product of
labor, gradually evoked, according to the
law of fitness, compass, and general proportion.
To bring its form into a natural
relation to wind and wave, was to find
perfect harmony and beauty. At first
the prow was too sharp, and the water
had rushed over it; the hold was too
shallow, and she sat ungracefully where
she now rides as mistress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emerson</span> quoted some German author
to the same effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Clarke</span> said there was something
in one of R. W. E.’s own Essays which
expressed the same thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emerson</span> laughed and said, “Very
important authority,” and would have
changed the subject, when—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William White</span> said that it did not
tally well with James Clarke’s theory
that the ugly steamer had succeeded the
beautiful clipper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Clarke</span> said the theory failed
only because there was no noble end in
view. The steamer was not intended to
be in harmony with Nature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emerson</span> asked if the Greeks had no
symbol for natural beauty. Several
were suggested that he would not accept,
but he finally took Diana on Charles
Wheeler’s suggestion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wheeler</span> then spoke of the birth of
Venus. He said many writers thought
the story as late as that of Psyche, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the line of Hesiod relating to it an
interpolation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> thought she should have
suspected this if she had never heard
it. The thought it expressed was too
comprehensive to be in keeping with
the remainder of her story.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Wheeler</span> would not accept
the criticism, but went on to talk about
the marriage of Venus with Mars, which
had amazed Olympus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said the Olympian Deities
were like modern men, who talk to
women forever about their softness and
delicacy, until women imagine that the
only good thing in man is a strong arm.
The girl elopes with a red coat, and the
indignant lords of creation wonder why
she did not appreciate their modest merit
and unobtrusive virtues. Poor Beauty
<em>weeps out</em> the crimson stain upon her
escutcheon in a long age of suffering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>A laugh followed this bright sally,
and then somebody said that Venus
once married Mercury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> declared that must be an
interpolation, for there were no points
of sympathy between the Goddess of
beauty and the God of craft.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James Clarke</span> did not know about
that; he thought that the finish and
completeness of the late robbery of
Davis, Palmer, &amp; Co. constituted a <em>kind
of beauty</em>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said that affair was altogether
grand; she had never heard of
anything so Greek as Williamson’s exclaiming,
“Gentlemen! you will not deprive
me of the implements of my
trade?” She could not help respecting
his impudence! The Greeks ought to
be respected for developing every human
faculty into deity. She thought lying,
stealing, and so forth only excesses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
a good faculty; and so did the Greeks,
for in their mistaken way they had
deified Mercury. The Spartans taught
their children to steal, and the Greeks
universally acknowledged that to cheat
was honorable if it could be concealed.</p>

<p>I remembered the passage in the
“Republic” where Polemarchus confesses
that he had learned from Homer
to admire Autolycus, grand sire of Ulysses,
distinguished above all men for his
thefts and oaths! Thrasymachus said
that the unjust were both prudent and
good, if they were able to commit injustice
to <em>perfection</em>! Is the immortality of
Autolycus the destiny of Williamson?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wheeler</span> said there certainly was a
well authenticated marriage between
Venus and Mercury.</p>

<p>I could not help thinking it might be
an astral connection that was indicated.
On that remarkable day of his birth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Mercury was not content with stealing
the divining-rod from Apollo; he took
also the cestus from Venus, the voice
from Neptune, the sword from Mars,
the will from Zeus, and his tools from
Vulcan! Sagacity compassed all the
deeps of divinity to reach its end.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ida Russell</span> asked if Venus and
Astarte were not the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said Astarte belonged to
the stars.</p>

<p>Did not Venus, I wonder? But of
course they are creations far asunder
as the poles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Wheeler</span> thought Astarte
and Venus Urania were the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ida</span> said that could not be. The first
statues of Astarte were rough blocks
of wood, with veiled heads.</p>

<p>So, I said, were all first statues of
Deities; so that was no argument.</p>

<p>When <span class="smcap">James Clarke</span> asked Margaret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
to compare Venus with the Madonna, a
curious talk arose between Alcott, Margaret,
Charles Wheeler, and Emerson.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alcott</span> wanted to know why Christ
was not as much an impersonation of a
human faculty as either of the Greek
Deities!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said Jesus was not a
thought. He was born on the earth, and
lived out a thought. He was no abstraction
to her, but a brother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alcott</span> wanted to know whether a
purer mythology, suited to the wants of
coming time, might not arise from the
mixed mythology of Persians, Greeks,
and Christians!</p>

<p>A very confusing and tiresome talk
arose thereupon, which Charles Wheeler
smiled at, but did not join in, and which
profited nobody.</p>

<span class="smaller">CUPID AND PSYCHE.</span></h2>

<p class="right"><i>April 9, 1841.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> thought it would be very
impertinent to begin by telling what
everybody knew,—the old story of
Cupid and Psyche.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> declared that Margaret never
told it twice alike, and at last she yielded
and said:—</p>

<p>The beautiful young princess Psyche
was envied by Venus, who sent Eros to
destroy her; but the God, finding Psyche
wholly lovely, wedded her. They lived
happily until Psyche began to doubt.
Eros had told her that she must not
seek to know him; but curiosity prevailed
over faith, and in looking at him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
as he slept she wounded and waked him.
He left her in dismay; and as a punishment
the three trials which are the lot
of mortals were awarded to her. She
must sort grain, she must bring three
drops from the river Styx, and must get
the box of beauty from Proserpine. The
birds helped her with the grain; but
when she reached the banks of the Styx
and stooped to fulfil the second task, she
found the water too dark, too cold, and
the eagle came to her aid. At the prospect
of the third trial her soul sank; she
refused to undertake it; but, winning
from one of the Gods the secret of self-dependence,
she set off for Tartarus,
gave the usual sop to Cerberus, and
returned with her prize. But she was
“possessed” with the idea that the
treasures the box contained might restore
to her her husband’s love, and she
opened the box as she came. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
noxious vapors which issued from it
deprived her of consciousness, and she
fell. Eros, who had flown to seek her
as soon as his wound was healed, brought
her the gift of Immortality which he had
begged of Jupiter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elisabeth Hoar</span> asked what had
become of Psyche’s sisters, whose interference
was a striking point in the story.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said she knew nothing of
them, and wished Miss Hoar would tell
us. Her own knowledge of the story was
gained entirely from Raphael’s original
studies, and his frescos on the walls of a
Roman palace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elisabeth Hoar</span> recapitulated. The
parents of Psyche were ordered by the
angry Venus to expose her upon a high
mountain, when Zephyr carried her to
the embraces of Love, who dwelt in the
depths of a quiet valley hard by. Her
sisters came to bewail her death, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Psyche begged Love to let Zephyr bring
them to rejoice in her happiness. For
some time he refused, telling her that it
was not for her good, and that she could
be happy without them. This our foolish
Psyche would not believe, and at last
they were permitted to come, only she
must not tell them the little she knew
about her husband.</p>

<p>The first time Psyche had sent them
away loaded with gifts. They had
questioned her about her husband, and
Psyche replied that he was only a lovely
child. The year went round, and again
the lovely bride longed for her sisters’
presence. Again the God entreated her
to be patient, assuring her that if they
came it would only be to make her
miserable. Psyche could not be quieted.
Again they came, again they questioned.
She forgot the story she had previously
told, and replied that he was an old man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
bent with years, but very kind to her.
Then the envious women saw that Psyche
was herself ignorant of his true nature.
They told her that he was a dragon, and
meant to devour her; that they had themselves
seen him as he passed through
the fields. They begged her to take a
knife and lamp and kill him as he slept.
The frightened Psyche consented.</p>

<p>The God was sleeping in radiant beauty
at her side, and as she gazed upon him
she drew an arrow from his quiver and
carelessly scratched her finger. Impassioned
by the wound, she bent over him,
and a drop of scalding oil fell from her
lamp. Angry and confused, the God
awoke, and, irritated by the pain, flew
away. Psyche clung to him; but she
could not support herself, and he was too
angry to hold her. She fell to the
ground, and he, perched upon a neighboring
tree, reproached her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> did not know this, but said
she remembered that Psyche tried to
drown herself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elisabeth</span> said that was later. She
despaired, and threw herself into the
river; but the river pitied her, and bore
her to the shore. Venus, growing tired
of her guest, sent Mercury to advertise
her. Psyche yielded to the terms of the
Goddess, rendered herself up, and was
busy sorting the gifts in the temple of
Beauty when Custom was sent to berate
her.</p>

<p>This, I suppose, is a condensation of
the lovely allegory of Apuleius in the
second century of our era, but it seems
to me Elisabeth made some additions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said that everybody had
to contend with the meddlesome sisters.
They were at the bottom of every fairy
story, from that of Psyche to Beauty
and the Beast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elisabeth Hoar</span> said it was always
with the young soul as it was with
Psyche. It could give no account of
the love which made it so happy.</p>

<p>So, I said, every human heart shrivels
under a curious touch. Love is angry
that we wound him, and if he ever does
return it is with Immortality in his hand.
When custom berates, God accepts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James Clarke</span> asked if there was not a
celebrated statue of Cupid and Psyche.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> had only heard of Canova’s,
but James said he was sure there was
one older.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Story</span> asked if it were older
than Apuleius, but James did not know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ida Russell</span> said it was wrong for
Psyche to look.</p>

<p>Yes, <span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said, but her temptations
were strong; and if they had not
come through her sisters, they must have
come through her own soul. Everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
was produced by antagonism. This
morning she had taken up Kreitzer,
meaning to open the Greek volume, but
took up the Indian. In that Mythology
which William Story called deep and all-embracing
there were the antagonist
principles of Vishnu, or unclouded innocence,
and Brahm, who could only become
pure by wading through all wickedness.
There seemed to be a need of sin, to
work out salvation for human beings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emerson</span> said faith should work out
that salvation. It was man’s privilege
to resist the evil, to strive triumphantly;
to recognise it—never! Good was always
present to the soul,—was all the
true soul took note of. It was a duty
not to look!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> thought it the climax of
sin to despair. She believed evil to be
a good in the grand scheme of things.
She would not recognize it as a blunder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
She must consider its scope a noble one.
In one word, she would not accept the
world—for she felt within herself the
power to reject it—did she not believe
evil working in it for good! Man had
gained more than he lost by his fall.
The ninety-nine sheep in the parable
were of less value than the “lost found,”
over which there was joy in heaven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> spoke of the Tree of Life,—which
would have made immortal those
who ate of the Tree of Knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Sturgis</span> said that this probation
was what she could not comprehend.
We began at the circumference,
and if we fulfilled our destiny must end
by being near the centre. How much
better to have begun there! Why could
not God have made it so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Story</span> began to say that
God must seek the best good of all his
creatures; but Caroline interrupted him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
by saying that there was certainly more
good at the centre than at the circumference.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William White</span> thought all this good,
better, and best very puzzling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> asked Caroline if she could
not see probation to be a good, as she
had herself defined it?</p>

<p>Are we better then, than God? asked
<span class="smcap">Caroline</span>.</p>

<p>Not better, replied <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>, for we
cannot compare dissimilar things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William White</span> asked if any one could
be more than good, more than pure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Story</span> said perfection had
its degrees!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">White</span> said, How can you progress
after you have reached your goal?</p>

<p>As if any live man ever <em>did</em> reach his
goal! said I.</p>

<p>Is there any progress for God? retorted
he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Not any, for that is a contradiction in
terms, I said; but surely you conceive of
it for souls in heaven?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said something about the
Gospel injunction to be perfect even as
our Father in Heaven is perfect. Does
not “even as” mean “after the pattern
of”? Does it involve the <em>nature</em>, as
well as the <em>degree</em>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emerson</span> interrupted quickly, “We
are not finite.”</p>

<p>Everybody smiled; but the best answer
to this is found in the fact, that
we never conceive of ourselves as infinite
and at rest,—only as reaching after the
Infinite in our motion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">White</span> said to Caroline Sturgis, “If
evil brings knowledge of good, is it
not a gain?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Story</span> talked nobly, something
to this effect: That good and
evil were related terms. If both did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
not exist, neither could, antagonism being
the spring of most things in the
universe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> went back to Cupid, and
said that in Raphael’s original studies
Cupid was always a boy,—in his frescos,
a youth, almost a man. She spoke of
the difference of expression which he
gave to his Venus and his Psyche,
especially in the eye. That of Psyche
was deep and thoughtful. The distinction
extended to their attendant Cupids,
and was most marked in the Psyche
when she takes the cup of Immortality
from her husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> wanted to pass on to
Diana, but there were too many clergymen
in the company. Everybody was
interested in somebody nearer at hand,
and views of the unchanging Providence
were next presented.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said God was the background<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
against which all creation was
thrown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Story</span> asked if she did
not think He was greater than his
creatures?</p>

<p>“Always beyond,” was <span class="smcap">Margaret’s</span>
reply.</p>

<p>Creation, <span class="smcap">Story</span> said, was rather the
exponent of a <em>Love</em> which <em>must bless</em>,
than of an activity which must act. It
was a Paternal power that <em>ruled</em>, not an
autocratic power which <em>fathered</em> us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said that the story of Cupid
and Psyche was the story of redemption.
It contained the seeds of the doctrine of
election,—saving by grace, and so on!</p>

<p>A good many queer things were said
on various points touched by this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emerson</span> said, that to imagine it
possible to fall was to <em>begin</em> to fall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> got into a little maze trying
to introduce Margaret and R. W. E.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
to each other,—a consummation which,
however devoutly to be wished, will
never happen!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James Clarke</span> told her that she was
just where Paul was when he said,
“What then? Shall I sin, that Grace
may the more abound?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emerson</span> said the woodlands could tell
us most about Diana, about whom we
contrived to say very little. The omission
of orgies in her worship was dwelt
upon. Her pure and sacred character
with the Athenians was compared to
that of the Diana of Ephesus, whose
orgies were not unusual, and who was
considered as a bountiful mother rather
than as a virgin huntress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ida Russell</span> said that <em>her</em> Mythology
accused Diana of being the mother of
fifty sons and fifty daughters!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> laughed, and said that certainly
was Diana of Ephesus!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>The maddening influence of moonlight
was commented upon, as if it were a
fable; but <span class="smcap">William Story</span> said it was a
fact. In tropical regions very sad consequences
resulted from long gazing on
the moonlight or sleeping in it. In one
town he had known sixteen persons
bewildered in this way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William White</span> said that in a late
book of Nichols it was contended that
the moon had some light of her own,
because she shows a brazen color even
under eclipse, when the dark side of the
earth is toward her. But why may she
not gather stellar light from the whole
universe, as the earth seems to?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sallie Gardiner</span> said something to
William Story in a low voice. He
laughed, and said he had been thinking
of the consequences of his theory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> asked what he was talking
about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Story</span> said it was an application of
eclipses to his theory that love was the
motive to creation. If the sun is beneficent
truth shorn of its beams, it would
be like the moon, no better than brass!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Sturgis</span> asked why the
Mahomedans bore the crescent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William White</span> said because of some
change in the moon which occurred at
the time of the Hegira.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Story</span> said that the worshippers
at Mecca carried the crescent
before Mahomet’s time. There is a crescent
on the black stone.</p>

<p>Both stories may be true. There is
certainly a crescent on the old Byzantine
coin, or besant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ida Russell</span> said something about
Diana being wedded.</p>

<p>This reminded <span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> of Minerva’s
marriage, discussed last week. She said
that Charles Wheeler had seen the gem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of which she then spoke, and that Neptune
was the favored suitor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Story</span> said the Greeks could
not wed Neptune to Diana, for the tides
were too low in the Mediterranean!</p>

<h2 id="VII">VII.<br />
<span class="smaller">PLUTO AND TARTARUS.</span></h2>

<p class="right"><i>April 15, 1841.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said very little about Pluto.
On the first evening she had called him
the depth of things, and <span class="smcap">James Clarke</span>
now had a good deal to say upon the
three ideas which she thought pervaded
the Greek mythology,—the source, the
depth, and the extent or flow of thought.
He said that this distinction had struck
him very forcibly when Margaret first
mentioned it. We speak of widely diffused
thought, of aspiring and profound
thought; of sympathetic, exalted, or deep
feeling,—and this seemed to exhaust
language. It was through the depths of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
feeling and experience that we came to
the profound of thought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> said, “There is no genius in
happiness.” Not a very intelligible
statement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said, “There is nothing
worth knowing that has not some penalty
attached to it. We pay it the more
willingly in proportion as we grow wise.
Depth, altitude, diffusion, are the three
births of Time. It is this which makes
the German cover the operations of the
miner with a mystic veil. Bostonians
laugh at the Germans because they
think.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wheeler</span> liked what Mr. Clarke said,
and added that there was meaning in the
Irish phrase, “<i>Lower me up</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said that all the punishments
of Tartarus expressed baffled effort,
the penalty least endurable to the
active Greek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Mack</span> thought it singular that in
every nation where the belief in Tartarus
had prevailed, an exact locality had always
been assigned to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William White</span> said that, so long as
anybody could point out the locality of
the garden of Eden, we had no need to
smile at the locality of a Tartarus or an
Elysium.</p>

<p>I do not think these “myths” belong
to the same class.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Wheeler</span> quoted Champollion
to the effect that the Styx was only
a small river flowing between the Temple
at Thebes and a neighboring “place
of tombs.” The ferryman was named
Charon, and the Egyptian habit of judging
the dead probably gave rise to the
rest of the fable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said, “This was very
natural.” She asked Mr. Wheeler the
meaning of certain names.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Phlegethon, he answered, meant burning
fire; Acheron, anguish.</p>

<p>Why did not somebody say that the
lifeless current of the Styx first tempted
Homer to give it to the Infernals? It is
in reality a river of Epeiros.</p>

<p>The Styx, <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span> said, was a cold
unhealthy stream, like that which caused
the death of Alexander. It flowed
slowly through Acadia, but was supposed
to take its rise in Hades. Lethe is a
river near the Syrtus in Africa. It disappears
in the sand, but rises again.
Hence its name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wheeler</span> had some difficulty in
explaining certain inconsistencies in the
poets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Clarke</span> quoted the remark of
Achilles (?) concerning Elysium,—that
a day of hard labor on earth was preferable
to an eternity of pleasure in Elysian
fields!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said that in Elysium, as in
Tartarus, souls waited. These restless
Greeks could do nothing. They were
cut off from action, which was their
delight. All their punishments seem to
consist of frustrated effort,—the consequence
of some presumption. Tantalus
was ever thirsty and ever famished because
he had aspired to nectar and
ambrosia. Ixion, who would have scaled
the heavens, was condemned to incessant
revolution upon a wheel, which never
paused yet never accomplished anything.
The Danaides, who murdered the love
which wooed them, were doomed to fill
a broken vessel with water which as
constantly escaped. Sisyphus, who had
never labored except for a selfish end,
was to roll a stone up hill, which as constantly
rolled down,—fit emblem of all
selfish labor. As for Tityrus, who sought
to violate the secrets of Nature, the
vulture fed always upon his entrails.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wheeler</span> said this did not represent
frustrated effort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said, No: this was remorse;
but there was an admirable
instance of the former given by Goethe,
of a man who wove rope from the
sedges which grew upon the banks of
Lethe, for an ass who continually devoured
it. The moral seemed to be that
the ass could just as well have eaten
them unwoven. Goethe goes on to say
that the Greeks only thought that the
poor man had a prodigal wife, but that
the moderns would look deeper and see
more in the fable.</p>

<p>We all weave sedges for asses to eat,
thought I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> seemed to think that every
heart might have an experience which
would correspond to Tartarus. Every
hero must visit it at least once.</p>

<p>I suggested Pluto, Persephone, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Fates, the Gorgons, the Furies, and
Cerberus. Pluto was equal to Neptune
and Jupiter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> continued: Hades was not
given to Pluto to mark defective character,
but simply as his kingdom. His
wants were all supplied. The bride
Olympus refused him he was permitted
to steal from earth while she gathered
flowers. Persephone, seed of all things,
must dwell in the dark; but another
legend tells us that if she had been
willing to leave her veil, she might
have stolen away. There was a meaning
in her being forbidden to eat in the
infernal regions. Fate said, “Do not
touch what you don’t want.” Psyche
was forbidden to partake of the regal
banquet Persephone spread. Seeking
for Immortality, this soul, like every
other, must be content to eat bitter
bread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>There was then a talk about Cerberus
and the Gorgons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Clarke</span> said that in the New
Testament the dog seemed to stand for
popular prejudice. The swine stood for
what <em>could</em> not, the dog for what <em>would</em>
not, be convinced.</p>

<p>Yes, <span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said, the wolf is a
misanthropic dog. He has little dignity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ida Russell</span> said Cerberus stood for
the temperaments.</p>

<p>Well, <span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said, that being so,
she liked the Greeks for making no
allowance for the lymphatic. To what,
she continued, do we offer the first sop,
as we pass through life? As for the
Gorgons, every one, she thought, would
find his own interpretation of them. To
her there was no Gorgon but <em>apathy</em>;
there is nothing in creation that will so
soon turn a live man into stone. These
Gorgons were three women, who used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
one eye and one tooth between them,—except
Medusa, who was beautiful and
perfect. Her hair had provoked the
envy of Minerva, and was changed into
serpents. Margaret had a copy of a
gem, which Marion Dwight had made
for her, which showed this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> asked if Perseus did not endeavor
to show Medusa her own head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said that might well rouse
her!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Wheeler</span> explained. Perseus
only used a mirror given him by
Minerva to avoid looking at the Gorgon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Sturgis</span> said that the old
woman who keeps house for Helen in
the second part of “Faust” was a Gorgon
to her.</p>

<p>This dragged a critical analysis of
the “Faust” forward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said the Seeker represents
the Spirit of the Age. He never sinned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
save by yielding, and yet he was emphatically
<em>saved by grace</em>. It was difficult
to see what Goethe meant until he
got to the Tower of the Middle Ages.
That made all clear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Wheeler</span> said, the reader
would a great deal rather that Faust
went to the Devil than not!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> defended Goethe’s way of
exhibiting character, of which Wilhelm
Meister was an instance. Goethe said
to himself, What should I do with a
hero in such rascally society? Meister
preferred the Brahmal experience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> asked if this moral indifference
was well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> replied, that it was just as
frightful as any other Gorgon. If we
are to have a purely intellectual development,
it was well for a man like Goethe
to represent it. To choose fairly between
evil and good, the intellect must
regard both with indifference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Somebody asked how the Gorgon’s
head came to be on the Ægis of
Minerva?</p>

<p>If Apathy is the Gorgon, surely Wisdom
needs it!</p>

<p>Then we began to talk about Theseus
in connection with Tartarus. Why
should he sit forever on a stone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> thought he represented
reform!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Mack</span> said reform checked itself
by its own fanaticism.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>, in this connection, asked
after the Greek notion of accountability.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> did not think the Greeks
had any.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wheeler</span> assured her to the contrary,
and told anecdotes to prove it. He
spoke of the fatal transmission of guilt in
one family, generation after generation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said the Greeks never
rejected facts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ida Russell</span> spoke of the last King of
Athens, Codrus, supposed to have been
punished for the crimes of his ancestors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wheeler</span> said that when the Greeks
killed some ambassadors, they felt so
sure that Heaven would avenge the sin
that they sent two citizens to expiate
it; but Darius, to whom they were sent,
refused to release the Greeks from their
impending doom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said the moment such a
supposition was started, there were
plenty of facts to sustain it. Orestes
is the purified victim of his family.
The old Greeks had made no complete
statement of their destiny or their
accountability.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> said they had made it in art.</p>

<span class="smaller">MERCURY AND ORPHEUS.</span></h2>

<p class="right"><i>April 22, 1841.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said it surprised her that
young men did not seek to be Mercuries.
She said that one of the ugliest young
men that she knew had become so enraptured
with one of Raphael’s Mercuries,
that he confessed to her that he
was never alone without trying to assume
its attitude before the glass. She said
she could not help laughing at the image
he suggested, an ugly figure in high-heeled
boots and a strait-coat in the
act of flying, commissioned with every
grace from Heaven to men! but she
respected the feeling, and thought every
sensitive soul must share it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emerson</span> had sent Sophia Peabody
several fine engravings. One of these,
a Correggio, represented a woman of
Parma as a Madonna. It might give
any woman a similar desire.</p>

<p>William Story, Frank Shaw, Mr. Mack
and his friends, Mrs. Ripley, Ida Russell,
and Mrs. S. G. Ward were all missing
to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said that she was sorry
she had allowed our subject to embrace
so much. The Grecian Mercury seemed
to mean so little that she had not thought
of the depth and difficulty connected
with the Egyptian Hermes. Among
the Greeks, Ceres, Persephone, and Juno
represent the productive faculties, Jupiter
and Apollo the divine, and Mercury
simply the human understanding, the
God of eloquence and of thieves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marianne Jackson</span> thought it strange
that he should be at once the God of
persuasion and the Deity of theft!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said eloquence was a kind
of thieving!</p>

<p>Did the Greeks so consider it? asked
<span class="smcap">Marianne</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said, Yes, more than any
nation in the world, and taught their
children so to do; and in fact such
mental recognitions were what distinguished
the nation from all other
peoples.</p>

<p>The Egyptian Hermes represented the
whole intellectual progress of man. If
one made a discovery it was signed Hermes,
and under that name transmitted
to posterity. Hence the forty volumes
of Hermetic theology, philosophy, and
so on. Individuals were merged in the
God. Hermes was always the mediator,
the peacemaker, and it was in this relation
that the beautiful story was told of
the caduceus. Mercury has originally
only the divining-rod which Apollo had
given him, but, finding two serpents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
fighting one day, he pacified them, and
had ever after the right to bear them
embracing on his rod. There was another
story, Margaret said, which she
could not understand,—the story of his
obtaining the head of the Ibis from
Osiris. Hermes kept the <em>first</em> or outside
gates of Heaven, a significant fact
typically considered.</p>

<p>I am sure there is something in
Heeren’s researches about the Ibis
story, but Caroline Sturgis said, No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William White</span> asked if the God gave
the name to the planet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said, Yes; and it was given
because it stood nearest the sun.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> said Plutarch had written something
about Hermes in his “Morals.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said, Perhaps so, but she
didn’t know, as she never <em>could</em> read
them. Plutarch went round and round
a story; presented all the corners of it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
told all the pretty bits of gossip he could
find, instead of penetrating to its secret.
So she preferred his anecdotes of Heroes
to his Parallels or Essays.</p>

<p>I said, in surprise, how much I liked
the “Morals.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” <span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said, “even Emerson
paid the book the high compliment
of calling it his tuning-key, when he
was about to write.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> said Coleridge was <em>her own</em>
tuning-key, and asked Margaret if she
had no such friendly instigator.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said she could keep up no
intimacy with books. She loved a book
dearly for a while; but as soon as she
began to look out a nice Morocco cover
for her favorite, she was sure to take a
disgust to it, to outgrow it. She did not
mean that she outgrew the author, but
that, having received all from him that
he could give her, he tired her. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
had even been the case with Shakespeare!
For several years he was her very life;
then she gave him up. About two
years ago she had occasion to look into
“Hamlet,” and then wished to refresh
her love, but found it impossible. It
was the same with Ovid, whose luxuriant
fancy had delighted her girlhood. She
took him up, and read a little with all
her youthful glow; but it would not last.
Friends must part, but why need we
part from our books? She regretted her
oddity, for she lost a great solace by it.</p>

<p>She proceeded to contrast the Apollo
with Mercury. In Egypt, Hermes was
the experimental Deity, the Brahma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroline Sturgis</span> asked what the
Hermes on the door-posts of the Athenian
houses meant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> thought that he posed
there as a messenger, an opener of the
gates merely, and then spoke of several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Mercuries by Raphael. One she knew,
so full of beauty and grace that it
seemed a single trumpet-tone. Another
all loveliness was handing the cup of life
to Psyche. She wondered that such
symbols as Apollo and Mercury did not
inspire all young men with ardor, and
make them something better than young
men usually are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William White</span> said Apollo was too
far beyond the average man to do this;
but that Mercury, graceful and vivacious,
would naturally attract the attention.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> asked if he would be an
easier model to imitate, and then repeated
her anecdote about the ugly youth who
longed to be a Mercury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William</span> said that if his faith had been
strong enough, the transformation might
have taken place.</p>

<p>Query—what is meant by strong
<em>enough</em>?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> spoke of the Egyptian
Osiris in his relation to Hermes, and
said that she did not like <em>him</em> to be
confounded with the Apollo. He was
in reality the Egyptian Jove.</p>

<p>This led me to speak of the Orphic
Hymn in which Apollo is addressed as
“immortal Jove.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said she had discovered
very little about Orpheus. In relation
to the five points of Orphic theology, she
had lately read a posthumous leaf from
Goethe’s Journal. The existence of a
Dæmon seemed to be a favorite idea
of his. He did not believe with Emerson
that all things were in our own souls,
but that they existed in <em>the original souls</em>,
(does anybody know what that means?)
and we must go out to seek them. This
notion Goethe thought verified by his
own experience. Goethe’s works, Margaret
thought, had more variety than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
anybody’s except Shakespeare’s. His
powers of observation seemed to condense
his genius.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William White</span> wondered why
Goethe showed such tenderness for
Byron.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said that in every important
sense Byron was his very opposite;
but Goethe hardly looked upon him as
a responsible being. He was rather the
instrument of a <em>higher</em> power. He was
the exponent of his period.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophia Peabody</span> had been making a
drawing of Crawford’s Orpheus at the
Athenæum. It was here brought down
for me to see.</p>

<p>At Sophia’s request, <span class="smcap">Margaret</span> repeated
a sonnet she had written on
it. She recited it wretchedly, but the
sonnet was pleasant.</p>

<p>I spoke of Bode’s Essay on the Orphic
Poetry, and sympathized in his view of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the spuriousness of the Hymns. They
might have been signed Orpheus, however,
as other things were signed Hermes,
simply because they were exponents of
Orphic thought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> dilated on this Orphic
thought.</p>

<p>I quoted Proclus in his Commentary
on Plato’s “Republic” as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mars perpetually discerns and nourishes,
and constantly excites the contrarieties of the
Universe, that the world may exist perfect
and entire in all its parts; but requires the
assistance of Venus, that he may bring order
and harmony into things contrary and discordant.</p>

<p>“Vulcan adorns by his art the sensible
universe, which he fills with certain natural
impulses, powers, and proportions; but <em>he</em>
requires the assistance of Venus, that he
may invest material effects with beauty, and
by this means secure the comeliness of the
world. Venus is the source of all the harmony
and analogy in the Universe, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the union of form with matter, connecting
and comprehending the powers of the elements.
Although this Goddess ranks among
the supermundane divinities, yet her principal
employment consists in beautifully illuminating
the order, harmony, and communion
of all mundane concerns.”</p>

</div>

<p>I asked <span class="smcap">Margaret</span> if this was not
something like her own thought,—this
Venus, for example, was it not better
than that we got from Greek art?</p>

<p>She said it was the primal idea, but
she did not attach much importance to
chronology. Philosophy must decide the
age of a thought.</p>

<p>I gave her as good an abstract of
Bode’s theory as I could.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William White</span> took the drawing of
Orpheus from me, and, while speaking
of its beauty, said it always made him
angry to think of the deterioration of
the human figure. He thought it ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
to have been prevented, and that his
ancestors had deprived him of his
rights.</p>

<p>Upon this, <span class="smcap">Margaret</span> entered into
a lively disquisition upon masculine
beauty. She said the best specimens
of it she had ever seen were a Southern
oddity named Hutchinson and some
Cambridge students who came from
Virginia.</p>

<p>We lost a finer talk to-night through
the inclemency of the weather. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>
was to have come with a great stock of
information. Had he done so, I need
not have quoted Bode or Proclus.</p>

<span class="smaller">HERMES AND ORPHEUS.</span></h2>

<p class="right"><i>April 29, 1841.</i></p>

<p>We did not have a very bright talk.
There were few present, and we had only
the subject of last week. <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>
did not speak at length. <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span> had
been ill, and his physician prescribed
light diet of both body and mind.</p>

<p>Somebody spoke of Mercury sweeping
the courts of the Gods, but that suggested
nothing to Margaret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah Shaw</span> had a pin, with a Mercury
on it, represented as holding the
head of a goat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> had never seen anything
that would explain it, and there was
some dispute about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> said that, according to the
Orphic Hymn, Mercury sought the love
of Dryope under the form of a goat.
Pan was the fruit of that amour. In
this form also he wooed Diana.</p>

<p>We wandered from our subject a little,
to hear <span class="smcap">Mr. Mack</span> talk about the Gorgons.
He thought they stood for the three sides
of human nature. Medusa, the chief
care-taker, the body, was the only one
not immortal, and the only one beautiful.
Stheno and Euryale, wide-extended force
and wide-extended scope, represented
spirit and intellect, essentially immortal.
The changing of Medusa’s curls (or elements
of strength) into serpents represented
the fall. It was not the Gorgons
who had but one eye and one tooth between
them, but three sister guardians,
whom Perseus was compelled to destroy
before he could reach Medusa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Mack</span> did not tell us why human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
nature so divided had a certain petrifying
power!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> thought the intellect, not the
body, was the care-taker. Mr. Mack tried
in vain to explain, owing, I think, to his
German misconception of words. Certainly
the five senses are the <em>providers</em>,
which was what he must have meant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> liked his theory, because
there was a place in it for sin! She
disliked failure. Perhaps we all had perceived
her attachment to evil! Not that
she wished men to fall into it, but it must
be accepted as one means of final good.</p>

<p>The only copies of Bode belong to
Edward Everett and Theodore Parker.
Neither is at this moment to be had.
The talk turned on the age of the
Orphic idea.</p>

<p>The Orphic Hymns, <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span> said,
were merely hymns of initiation into the
Orphic mysteries. They were altered by
every successive priesthood, and finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
by the Christian Platonists. Those now
remaining were undoubtedly their work.
Perhaps the ancient formulas were still
hidden in them. We know the beautiful
story of Orpheus. If he indeed represents
many, yet all that has been said
of him is also true of one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Mack</span> declared that Eurydice
represented the true faith! She was
killed by an envenomed serpent, which
might possibly stand for an enraged
priesthood!</p>

<p>I got a little impatient here, and said
I did not care to know about the Hymns;
but the Orphic idea, which made Scaliger
speak of the Hymns as the “Liturgy of
Satan,”—how old was that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> could not guess why he
called them so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Wheeler</span> said that, since
they made a heathen worship attractive,
perhaps he fancied them a device of the
Evil One!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Too great a compliment to Scaliger, I
thought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> had no objection to Orpheus
as crowning an age; she liked that multitudes
should produce one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Wheeler</span> said that Carlyle
had spoken of Orpheus as standing in
such a relation to the Greeks as Odin
bore to the Scandinavians.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said at this point (I don’t
see with what pertinency) that Carlyle
displeased her by making so much of
mere men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James Clarke</span> quoted Milton, speaking
of himself among the revellers of
the Stuart Court, as like Orpheus among
the Bacchanals.</p>

<p>I said that Bode placed Homer in the
tenth century before Christ, and Orpheus
in the age just preceding, say the thirteenth
century before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Mack</span> thought all that mere
conjecture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>I told him it made a good deal of
difference to me whether the Orphic
Mythology came before or after that of
Homer. Had man grown out of the
noble and into the base idea? Was all
our knowledge only memory? Had the
Orphic fancies no beauty till the Platonic
Christians shaped them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> responded to what I said,
that she did not like a mind always
looking back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> said there was a great deal of
consolation in it. Memory was prophecy.
She didn’t like such a mind,
but since she happened to have it she
wanted support for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Mack</span> said all history offered such
support.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Wheeler</span> didn’t like to
believe it, but felt that he must. He
spoke of the Golden Age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said every nation looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
back to this; but, after all, it was only
the ideal. The past was a curtain on
which they embroidered their pictures
of the present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William White</span> said that all great
men looked to the appreciation of the
future. We are too near to the present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> agreed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> said, all the science of Europe
could not offer anything like the old
Egyptian lore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said the moderns needed
the assistance of a despotic government.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Wheeler</span> spoke of the monuments
in Central America; but before
he could utter what was in his mind,
<span class="smcap">Margaret</span> interrupted, saying that all
the greatness of the Mexicans only sufficed
to show their littleness. We might
have lost in grandeur and piety, but
we had gained in a thousand tag-rag
ways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrar</span> whispered to me, “Write
that down!” and I have done it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Wheeler</span> said that late discoveries
proved that there was a complete
knowledge of electricity among
the ancients. There were lightning-rods
on the temple at Jerusalem, and they
are described by Josephus, who however
does not know what they are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> and I clung to the “tag-rag”
gain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Wheeler</span> agreed with me in
thinking the Orphic Hymns of very late
origin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> could not see the use of
creating a race of giants to prepare the
earth for pygmies! If these must exist,
why not in some other sphere? She
referred to the beautiful Persian fable.
The <em>first</em> was God, of course; since man
may always revert to Him, what matter
about the giants?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>I said that primitive ages were supposed
to be innocent rather than great.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said the Persian fable bore
to the same point as the Vishnu and
Brahma. It was antagonism that produced
all things. The universe at first
was one Conscious Being,—“I am;” no
word, no darkness, no light. This Conscious
Being needed to know itself, and
it passed into darkness and light and a
third being,—the Mediator between the
two. This Trinity produced ideals,—men,
animals, things; and after a period
of twelve thousand years all return
again into the One, who has gained
by the phenomena only a multiplied
consciousness.</p>

<p>“Were they <em>merged</em>?” asked <span class="smcap">Charles
Wheeler</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said, “No! once created,
they could not lose identity.”</p>

much! Her life hangs on a thread.
Her face is full of the marks of pain.
Young as I am, I feel old when I look
at her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> spoke of Hercules as representing
the course of the solar year.
The three apples were the three seasons
of four months each into which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
ancients divided it. The twelve labors
were the twelve signs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> accepted this, and spoke of
Bryant’s book, which Margaret did not
like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said Bryant forced every
fact to be a point in a case. Bending
each to his theory, he falsified it. She
wished English people would be content,
like the wiser Germans, to amass classified
facts on which original minds could
act. She liked to see the Germans so
content to throw their gifts upon the
pile to go down to posterity, though
the pile might carry no record of the
collectors. She spoke of Kreitzer, whose
book she was now reading, who coolly
told his readers that he should not
classify a second edition afresh, for his
French translator had done it well
enough, and if readers were not satisfied
with his own work, they must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
recourse to the translation. This she
thought was as it ought to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James Clarke</span> said it always vexed
him to hear ignorant people speak of
Hercules as if he were a God, and of
Apollo and Jupiter as if they might at
some time have been men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said, Yes, the distinction
between Gods and Demigods was that
the former were the creations of pure
spontaneity, and the latter actually existent
personages, about whose heroic
characters and lives all congenial stories
clustered.</p>

<p>J. F. C. did not like the statues of
Hercules; the brawny figure was not to
his taste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> thought it majestic. She
said he belonged properly to Thessaly,
and was identified with its scenery. She
told several little stories about him.
That of his sailing round the rock of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Prometheus, in a golden cup borrowed
of Jupiter, was the least known. She
told the story from Ovid, the glowing
account of his death, of the recognition
by delighted Jove. She said Wordsworth’s
“Tour in Greece” gave her
great materials for thought.</p>

<p>Then she turned to Bacchus.</p>

<p>To show in what manner she supposed
Bacchus to be the <em>answer</em> or complement
to Apollo, she mentioned the statement
of some late critic upon the relation of
Ceres and Persephone to each other.</p>

<p>Persephone was the hidden energy,
the vestal fire, vivifying the universe.
Ceres was the productive faculty, external,
bounteous. They were two
phases of one thing. It was the same
with Apollo and Bacchus. Apollo was
the vivifying power of the sun; its genial
glow stirred the earth, and its noblest
product, the grape, responded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>She spoke of the Bacchanalian festivals,
of the spiritual character attributed
to them by Euripides, showing that originally
they were something more than
gross orgies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Clarke</span> (<span class="smcap">Ann Wilby</span>) said that
they licensed the wildest drunkenness
in Athens.</p>

<p>I said that was at a later time
than Euripides undertook to picture.
Were they identical with the Orphic?
Did Orpheus really bring them from
Egypt?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> would accept that for a
<em>beginning</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> thought that next winter
we might have a talk about Roman
Mythology.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> liked the idea, and <span class="smcap">James
Clarke</span> seemed to accept it for the whole
party. He said that he had never felt
any interest in the Greek stories, until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Margaret had made them the subject of
conversation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. P. P.</span> said she had felt excessively
ashamed all through that she knew so
little.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> said no one need to feel
so. It was a subject that might exhaust
any preparation. Still, she wished we
<em>would</em> study! She had herself enjoyed
great advantages. Nobody’s explanations
had ever perplexed her brain. She
had been placed in a garden, with a
great pile of books before her. She
began to read Latin before she read
English. For a time these deities were
real to her, and she prayed: “O God!
if thou art Jupiter!” etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James Clarke</span> said he remembered
her once telling him that she prayed to
Bacchus for a bunch of grapes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> smiled, and said that when
she was first old enough to think about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Christianity, she cried out for her dear
old Greek gods. Its spirituality seemed
nakedness. She could not and would
not receive it. It was a long while
before she saw its deeper meaning.</p>

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
